# Gate Futures Close Position — Scenarios & Prompt Examples

Gate futures close-position scenarios and expected behavior.

## Position query (dual vs single mode)

**In dual mode**, `cex_fx_get_fx_position(settle, contract)` fails (API returns an array). Use **`cex_fx_list_fx_positions(settle, holding=true)`** or **`cex_fx_get_fx_dual_position(settle, contract)`** when account is in dual mode (`cex_fx_get_fx_accounts` → `position_mode === "dual"` or `in_dual_mode === true`). In single mode use **`cex_fx_get_fx_position(settle, contract)`**.

## Scenario 1: Close all (one-click)

**Context**: User wants to close all positions regardless of size.

**Prompt Examples**:
- "Close all"
- "One-click close"
- "Close all positions"
- "close all positions"

**Expected Behavior**:
1. Call `cex_fx_list_fx_positions(settle="usdt")` to get all positions.
2. Show position list and confirm: "Confirm close all positions?"
3. After confirm, for each contract with position: call `cex_fx_create_fx_order(settle="usdt", contract=..., size=opposite size, reduce_only=true, ...)` market close (negative size to close long, positive to close short; tif="ioc", price="0").
4. Query `cex_fx_list_fx_positions` again to verify no (or negligible) position left.
5. Output close result with realized PnL.

**Response Template**:
```
Confirm close all positions? Current positions:
- BTC_USDT long 5 contracts, unrealised PnL +$200

(After user confirms)

All positions closed.

| Contract   | Side | Size | Fill price | Realised PnL |
|------------|------|------|------------|--------------|
| BTC_USDT   | Long | 5    | $52,000    | +$200        |

No open positions.
```

## Scenario 2: Partial close (specified size)

**Context**: User wants to close part of the position and keep the rest.

**Prompt Examples**:
- "Close 2 contracts"
- "Close 3 BTC contracts"
- "Reduce 1 contract"
- "Partial close, close 2 long"

**Expected Behavior**:
1. Query current position to verify sufficient size.
2. Compute close size (negative for long, positive for short).
3. Call `cex_fx_create_fx_order(size=-2, reduce_only=true, tif="ioc")` (or equivalent).
4. Verify remaining position.

**Response Template**:
```
Partial close done.

| Item        | Value        |
|-------------|--------------|
| Contract    | BTC_USDT     |
| Closed size | 2 contracts |
| Fill price  | $52,000      |
| Remaining   | Long 3       |

Close done; 3 long contracts remaining.
```

## Scenario 3: Close half

**Context**: User wants to close half of the position.

**Prompt Examples**:
- "Close half"
- "Close half of position"
- "Reduce 50%"

**Expected Behavior**:
1. Query position: size = 10.
2. Half: close_size = 5.
3. Call `cex_fx_create_fx_order(size=-5, reduce_only=true)`.
4. Verify remaining = 5.

**Response Template**:
```
Half closed.

| Item      | Before | After   |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| Size      | 10     | 5       |
| Side      | Long   | Long    |
| Fill price| -      | $52,000 |

## Scenario 4: Reverse (long to short)

**Context**: User is long and wants to reverse to short.

**Prompt Examples**:
- "Reverse"
- "Reverse to short"
- "Long to short"
- "Close long open short"

**Expected Behavior**:
1. Query position via **position query** (dual: `cex_fx_list_fx_positions` or `cex_fx_get_fx_dual_position`; single: `cex_fx_get_fx_position`): long +5.
2. Show reverse plan and ask user to confirm (include estimated liq/margin).
3. After confirm: first `cex_fx_create_fx_order(settle, contract, size="-5", reduce_only=true, price="0", tif="ioc")` to close long, then `cex_fx_create_fx_order(..., size="-5", price="0", tif="ioc")` to open 5 short (no reduce_only).
4. Verify new position via **position query** (same as above): short -5.

**Response Template**:
```
Reverse done.

| Item   | Before | After   |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Side   | Long   | Short   |

2. Show reverse plan; after confirm: first `cex_fx_create_fx_order(..., size="3", reduce_only=true, price="0", tif="ioc")` to close short, then `cex_fx_create_fx_order(..., size="3", price="0", tif="ioc")` to open 3 long.
3. Verify new position: long +3.
